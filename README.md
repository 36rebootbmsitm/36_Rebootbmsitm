UniData Hub: The Smart Campus Solution for Streamlined NBA, NIRF, & NAAC

Our institution's faculty members are dedicated to excelling in teaching, learning, and research. However, a significant bottleneck emerges when it comes to accreditation processes like NBA, NIRF, and NAAC submissions. Faculty and staff often face redundant, time-consuming clerical work, re-entering the same data across multiple formats and documents for each assessment.
This project proposes developing a centralized, intelligent data entry platform to eliminate this inefficiency. Our goal is to create a system where faculty input their professional data once, and the platform automatically maps and populates this information into the specific formats required by NBA, NIRF, and NAAC.
For example: When a faculty member enters their publication details into the system (e.g., as part of an R&D module), this information will be automatically linked and formatted for the relevant sections in NBA accreditation files, NIRF ranking reports, and NAAC documentation, without any additional manual data entry.
Key benefits of this solution include:
•	Significant reduction in clerical workload for faculty and administrative staff.
•	Improved data accuracy and consistency across all accreditation and ranking submissions.
•	More time for faculty to focus on core activities like teaching, learning, and research.
This hackathon project will focus on building the core framework for this platform, demonstrating the automated data mapping capabilities with a few key data points (e.g., publications, projects, workshops attended).r
